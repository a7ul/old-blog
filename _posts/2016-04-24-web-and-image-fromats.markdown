**Images** are the most common assets in web pages and apps. Using the right format with proper customization can greatly increase the performance and user experience.There are multiple formats supported by browsers today. Most common of them are :

1. JPEG
2. PNG
3. GIF
4. SVG
5. WebP*

I wanted to find out which is the best from a web designer/developers perspective.

# Some important criteria we are going to use to compare them:

- **Compression**

  _Images are compressed to reduce redundant data in the images to save memory._

  - **_Lossy_** - _It means once you decompress the compressed image data, you will not get the exact same original image. The difference is generally not noticeable though by looking at them.It is good for web as it consumes very less space/memory as compared to lossless._

  - **_Lossless_** - _In this case, you will get exactly the same image as the original upon decompression. The downside is ,the compressed image generally takes up more space as compared to lossy. Hence can be sometimes bad for web._

- **Transparency**

  _Transparency allows to see through certain sections of images. This allows it to take any shape in the webpage. As transparency requires additional information to be stored in the image. It generally consumes more memory._

- **Animation Support**

  _It allows to store multiple frames of images into a single images , thus allowing to create animations._

- **License**
- **Browser Support**
