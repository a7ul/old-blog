Whatsapp has the largest user base in comparison to any chat application out there.
Even though its so popular, it lacks in some features that the users want.
For example , it can be installed only on one device at a given time. But consider that many of us have two phones,
One for business and other one for personal use. But sometimes we need to access whatsapp we need to carry both phones to the office.

I figured out a hack for accessing whatsapp on both my phones simultaneously.

<div style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Bear in mind that this is a hack and will not give you the seamless experience that you want.</div>
If it doesn't work for you then we wait till the time whatsapp adds this functionality.

### Instructions

- Lets say you have two phones A and B and whatsapp is installed on phone A.

- All you need to do is install chrome on phone B.

- Open `google.com` or any site via chrome.

- Go to the options and select `Request Desktop Site`.

</div>
<br>

- Now open `web.whatsapp.com`.

- Scan the QR code displayed on the phone B using whatsapp on phone A.

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>
<br>

- **Boom !** You have `web.whatsapp` working on phone B.

</div>
<br>


The `web.whatsapp` site is not very responsive since it was not designed for phones, so you might face issues, but well alteast its better than nothing ðŸ˜ŽÂ ðŸ˜›

Like I said , `Its a hack !`
